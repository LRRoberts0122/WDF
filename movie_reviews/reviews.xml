		<title>Lèon the Professional</title>
		<category>Thriller</category>
		<description>Lèon is one of the world's greatest assassins. A professional hitman, he lives a very discrete life and goes by a strict code: no women, no children. Lèon is extremely cautious and meticulous. He sleeps sitting upright in a chair with his gun to his side. You won't catch him making mistakes. Jean Reno plays Lèon, the professional. You soon realize he has a soft spot for Mathilda, a young girl played by Natalie Portman. Prior to this movie, I'd never heard of the actress, and to this day, I would say this was her finest acting to date. She plays a very influential part, and you can't help but feel bad for her after her parents are killed by the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency). The antagonist is Stansfield (Gary Oldman), a crooked cop that has a heavy pill-popping addiction. Out of all the movies I've seen with "professional killers," Lèon The Professional stands out as one of the best, if not the greatest of all time. Others can claim to be the original hitman, but this one sets the bar. This movie can absolutely be accredited to building both Natalie Portman's and Gary Oldman's acting careers. Not only does it tell a great story, but it also has a wonderful ending that leaves you sad, happy, and satisfied all at once.</description>
