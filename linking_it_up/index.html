    	<p>If you're reading this, you're probably doing some research about Full Sail University, and you're noticing that there's two extremes in term of reviews: the people that love Full Sail and the people that hate Full Sail. I try to stay neutral by posting my work online and letting you decide for yourself whether or not you think this school will be right for you. Below are some topics that I am going to post my unofficial review on, and if you're interested, you can continue to view the work I've done on my blog up to this point in the program. And actually, as an interesting "Fact of the Day," this introduction that you're reading is actually part of a project for my Web Design Fundamentals class. That being besides the point, let's get down to business. The stuff that you really want to know about. Well here are some quick links to following topics if you find yourself particularly eager:</p>

   			<h3>The Curriculum</h3>
    		<p>With Full Sail's motto, "Real World Education," you may find that the industry changes quite frequently. That being said, the Course Directors are constantly making revisions to their classes. This could be a good thing, or a bad thing, depending on the circumstances. Most of the time, it's a good thing: they're trying to get their class up-to-date with what people are doing in the industry today. You will probably experience this with several classes throughout your time in the program. However, with most teachers, it's experimentational, and sometimes this experimentation can hurt your education experience if you're not careful with new projects and requirements. Just do the best that you can and you'll come out fine.</p>
    		<p>Above all, the first part of the education cirriculum has been quite smooth. I've been getting A's or A+'s for what it's worth, and even a Course Director's award. However, there is one thing that irritated me a little last month, and I thought I should bring it to attention in case someone up the ladder sees this. I recently had a problem where there were requirements for both, input hints and input prompts. I had input prompts in each one of my input fields, acting as labels for their respective field. The Course Director got onto me about not having both requirements. I said to him (almost verbatum from what I can remember), "Yes, but looking at my projects, do I actually <em>need</em> them?" He asked me if I wanted the Full Sail answer or the real-world answer. I asked for the real-world answer because that's the education I'm coming to Full Sail for: A real world education. He said, no, I didn't need input hints because I used my prompts effectively. I did go back and rework my design to have an input hint, but what I'm trying to say is that: If a student can <em>effectively</em> show how their design does not facilitate the need for a hint versus a prompt, or vice versa, then they obviously know the difference. Besides, I already demonstrated my knowledge of the two with the ESPN KAM project in Web Interfaces and Usability and it feels redunant to have this appear again and not give me a choice between the two. There will be many instances throughout the program like this one, where curriculum requirements will be forced down your throat, but it's something you just have to deal with. Smile, rework the design, and be greatful you don't have to bother with it when you graduate.</p>

    		<h3>The Staff</h3>
    		<p>During my time at Full Sail, I've been through two degrees and I've experienced my fair share of instructors, both from what I perceive to be good and bad. Just like any University, there are some people here that aren't perceptive to new ways of thinking and pigeonhole you into "this is wrong" when it's really not-so-bad. My Final Project for Advanced Computer Graphics is a great example. One of the lab instructors didn't like any of my design choices, out of about twelve different possibilities. I got frustrated with his feedback and ended up going down my own road, down one he specficially didn't like. I ended up getting an A+ on that project along with a lot of compliments from other people.</p>
    		<p>There's not all-bad at Full Sail. I'd actually say that's the vast minority, or the one percent. On the other side of the radical, I had one teacher that monitored the time he put into his class to continuously refine it, and the effort paid off. It was a smooth class, though equally challenging. Most of the teachers are here because they love to teach, and they're in turn, teaching something they love to do. The learning experience becomes quite different. I also had a teacher who took extra time to have study groups with the class before the tests, and I have to say, I don't think I'd have done so well if it weren't for that. All in all, there are some bad apples, but that's a rare occurence. I've gone month to month without a bad experience in terms that my teachers did the best they could in relaying that information to me, and it was extremely helpful.</p>

    		<h3>The Campus</h3>
   		 	<p>I know I keep promising you pictures. I'll have to remember to take some at some point or another. The classrooms are extremely efficient. Each desk provides power outlets and ethernet jacks so you can maintain a stable connection to the internet and keep your computer charged. They have nice chairs, as well. This experience isn't so much for the Game Art and Computer Animation degree as much as it is for Web Design and Development. The projectors in the rooms are quite outdated, however, and you'll notice from time to time that there's always something wrong with it. The other thing is that almost every class, there seems to be an incident of a flashing lightbulb. Be on your guard if you have epilepsy. Other than that, there are a few random things for other programs here and there that are extremely beneficial. There is a lab with Cintique drawing tablets, special light tables for animation among a multitude of other things. If you'd like to see more, you can go to the Behind-the-Scenes tour or schedule a private tour.</p>
    		<p>Full Sail expands by buying buildings around it. A lot of the campus buildings are renovations of stores that were previously there. For example, Albertsons was a marketplace that Full Sail bought and then rennovated the building into classrooms. A lot of people try to put negative comments on Full Sail about how they're in old movie theaters with broken chairs. Trust me, it's not that bad. Full Sail's campus actually has quite a bit of technology behind it that other students don't have access to at other schools. Another myth I've heard circulating the internet is that people have had to avoid putting "Full Sail University" on their resumes to get a job. This is one of those moments where I'm going to have to be brutally honest. A lot of the people here do not put in 100%. The teachers will tell you this from their experience, and as you move throughout the program, you'll see it for yourself, too. People do the bare minimum to scrape by. That is what ends up getting in their portfolio, or demo-reel, and when they try to sell themselves in the industry, no one wants the mediocre crap they've produced, because the competition is so high already. A lot of people giving negative feedback like that will talk a big game, but they're really the people who paid $75,000.00 to work at McDonald's down the street. If you give it everything you've got from the moment you walk in that door, to the moment you graduate, you'll be one of the graduates working at the big-name companies right off the bat. You wouldn't have the time to write negative comments online about Full Sail if you put in enough effort into landing that dream job anyway. Keep that in mind when you're reading review from the radical haters.</p>

	    	<h3>The Parking</h3>
	    	<p>Normally I wouldn't have included this if a lot of people weren't mentioning this on their reviews. Parking is not as bad as people make it out to be. There's plenty of parking in the Building Four parking lot. However, they need to expand (and pave) the lots behind Building One and Two. Building Three usually has efficient parking. I can almost always find a spot, even if it's the one in the very back. I don't have to go to Building Three very often, but if you find yourself going there frequently, I would recommend keeping an umbrella on hand in your backpack, just in case. I can't say I've run into a problem where I couldn't find a parking spot, ever. I think people moan and gripe a lot because they have to walk. If you don't mind walking a little (and it's not even a lot: it's like walking from the back of a Walmart's parking lot to the door at the farthest), you'll have nothing to worry about.</p>
