	<h1>Some Of My Work</h1>
        
	<p>Here's a couple of things that I've done throughout the Web Design and Development program. Each one of these is my own work and is protected under the DMCA and a Creative Commons license. If you link to it, please give a link-back for creditation!</p>

		<h3>JPEG</h3>
		<p>This image uses a JPEG compression. JPEGs are best used for any kind of photos or illustrations, such as this photo-realistic composition.</p>
    <div>
    	<img src="images/starry_night.jpg" alt="A realistic composition inspired by Vincent Van Goh's Starry Night." title="Starry Night Photoreal" width="1000" height="800" />
  	</div>
        
   	<h2>The Acme Movie Reviews Logo</h2>
    <p>This logo was for Advanced Design Tools and Interfaces for the Acme Movie Reviews project. The "A" is made to resemble a film strip to help give the logo a unique look-and-feel.</p>
    
    <h3>GIF</h3>
    <p>This is the 8-bit GIF version of the Acme Movie Reviews logo.</p>
    <div id="gifdivLogo">
    	<img src="images/logo.gif" alt="An 8-bit GIF version of the Acme logo." title="Acme Movie Reviews Logo GIF-8 bit" width="612" height="237" />
    </div>
    
    <h3>PNG-8</h3>
    <p>This is the 8-bit PNG version of the Acme Movie Reviews logo. Notice how there isn't much of a difference between the 8-bit GIF and the 8-bit PNG.</p>
    <div id="png8divLogo">
    	<img src="images/logo_8.png" alt="An 8-bit PNG version of the Acme logo." title="Acme Movie Reviews Logo PNG-8 bit" width="612" height="237" />
    </div>
    
    <h3>PNG-24</h3>
    <p>This is the 24-bit PNG version of the Acme Movie Reviews logo. This one is obviously much nicer than the other images.</p>
    <div id="png24divLogo">
    	<img src="images/logo_24.png" alt="A 24-bit PNG version of the Acme logo." title="Acme Movie Reviews Logo PNG-24 bit" width="612" height="237" />
